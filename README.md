# The Ice Maze

The game was built as part of an assignment in a computer game development course.

The purpose of the assignment is to build a "game" where the player can move in a 2D world using the arrow keys, and at the same time he sees his location on a small map (map-mini) on the upper right side.


The player's goal is to get through the maze and return home to the igloo.
